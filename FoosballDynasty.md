#Foosball Dynasty
##Description
Balaji and his coworkers like to play Foosball on their lunch break.Foosball is a game
typically played by 2 players (individual matchup) or 4players (team play). However, 
due to the increasing interest and availabilityof coworkers, Balaji has created a new
variation that supports 5 ormore players. Each individual point is played by four
players: two on the White team and two on the Black team.
